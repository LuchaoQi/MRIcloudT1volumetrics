`MRIcloudT1volumetrics` is an R package for working with the
output of MRIcloud T1 volumetric data. As of this writing, the
package has three purposes:

1. It text parses and reads in data from the most popular T1 processing
algorithms through the function `readSubject`
2. It can convert that data into a dataframe.
3. It can read in a series of files and concatentate them into a dataframe


Here's an example of basic reading in of one subject. 
```{r}
library(MRIcloudT1volumetrics)
fileLoc = system.file("extdata", "kirby127a_3_1_ax_283Labels_M2_corrected_stats.txt",
 package="MRIcloudT1volumetrics")
test = readSubject(fileLoc)
length(test)
test[[1]]
```
